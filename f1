~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`
SCENARIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`

A new deployment has caused production downtime. Walk me through your troubleshooting steps and how you'd rollback safely.
==>>
- First, check monitoring/logs. 
- Rollback via 'kubectl rollout undo' or revert Helm release. 
- Perform root cause analysis (RCA) post-recovery.

Your Jenkins pipeline is frequently failing due to intermittent test failures. How would you investigate and stabilize it?
==>>
- Analyze test logs, check flaky test patterns, isolate tests, and run them independently. 
- Introduce retry logic and test parallelization.

A security vulnerability has been found in one of your base images. What’s your approach to fixing this across all services?
==>
- Scan images using Trivy or Clair, update base image (e.g., python:3.11 → patched version), rebuild and redeploy. 
- Use automated alerts for CVEs.

Your Kubernetes pods are getting killed due to OOM (Out of Memory) errors. How would you debug and resolve this?
==>
- Check pod logs and describe output. Increase memory limit if justified. 
- Optimize application memory usage or add liveness probes.

The infrastructure team wants to migrate the CI/CD pipelines to another region or cloud provider. What are your key considerations?
==>
- Export pipeline definitions (e.g., Jenkinsfiles or GitLab CI YAML). 
- Validate dependencies, test pipelines in the new region/cloud, and update secrets/envs securely.

You need to onboard a new developer and give them minimal access to production. How would you set this up securely?
==>
- Assign read-only access to production logs via IAM or RBAC. 
- Restrict AWS CLI/Kubeconfig access using least privilege principles.

Your application has to be deployed in a multi-cloud environment with disaster recovery. How would you architect the DevOps process?
==>
- Use multi-region deployments with IaC, data replication (e.g., S3 cross-region), and DNS failover (e.g., Route 53). 
- Ensure pipeline supports deploying to both clouds with toggles.
